# Crown App

The Crown frontend and centralized layer: site, creator cabinet, campaigns, mini-games, OBS overlays.

**Outside the trusted perimeter — no money, no keys.** This app only reads the open ledger of [Crown-Core](https://github.com/Crown-protocol/Crown-Core) and renders it. Settlement happens on-chain, past this code.

## What this is

Creator donations with no middleman between the donor's wallet and the recipient. The payment goes into an immutable splitter on Solana, the donation lands in a reputation ledger on ICP, and Crown App shows it to the viewer and the streamer — profile, goals, OBS overlay.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript |
| Solana | `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/spl-token`, base58 |
| ICP | `@dfinity/agent`, `@dfinity/candid` |
| Storage | SQLite via `@libsql/client` |
| Signatures | `tweetnacl` (ed25519) |

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Checks:

```bash
npm run verify:chain   # network and addresses
npm run verify:db      # database schema and invariants
```

The Telegram bot runs as a separate process:

```bash
npm run bot            # reads bot/.env
```

## Layout

## Database

SQLite at `data/crown.db`. The `donations` table is written **only by the indexer** — never by hand, or it will drift from the chain.
